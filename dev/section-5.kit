                    Following this concept, Matisse is an influential figure of the 20th century, 
                    and a decisive figure of the time. By defining a clearly pictoral language, 
                    of colors and arabasque lines, rather than looking at painting as a means to an end,
                     Matisse had a great impact on future movements, and works, produced by artists in the 20th century.
